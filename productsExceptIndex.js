/*
Write a function productsExceptIndex() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

For example, given:
  [1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:
  [84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating:
  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]

NOTE: Do not use division in your solution.
